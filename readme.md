## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Solid JS](https://docs.solidjs.com/quick-start) - JS library
- [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/) - UI framework agnostic
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For styles

### What I learned
the purpose behind the stack choice was to learn how to build static files with astro, especially for landing pages, using various UI frameworks, similar to Gatsby with React. see what I learned below:

#### core concepts
+ .astro files (for pages, layouts and components)
+ integrations and templates
+ component islands

#### cool stuff
+ suport for view transitions
+ endpoints & middleware
+ localization
